EnanoBot is a bot I wrote for the Enano CMS IRC channel in #enano on freenode. It's
written in CLI PHP and you need to have shell access, a MySQL server, and a host
with a very permissive TOU or a reliable home connection to run this bot.

FEATURES
--------------------

   - Basic logging
   - Privileged users - automatically opped and can speak through the bot, among
     other things
   - Snippets - use for automated help
   - Web-based log viewer
   - Web-based snippet manager

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------

  - MySQL server
  - SSH access
  - PHP on your shell server
  - Working Enano installation
  - The MySQL user Enano uses needs to have access to EnanoBot's database if it's
    not the same one that you're using for Enano

NOTE ON ISP RESTRICTIONS
--------------------

A lot of ISPs (webhosts) prohibit running IRC bots from your shell account. Check
with their terms of use before you enable this thing. Because this project is under
the GPL there is of course no warranty for it, and nobody from the Enano Project
can be responsible for your use of this bot. So make sure it's OK before you try to
run it.

INSTALLING
--------------------

Copy config-sample.php to config.php and edit it. Then put irclogs.php and
snippets.php wherever your Enano installation is. You could probably modify snippets
to not use Enano pretty easily but securing it would be your job. Edit both irclogs
and snippets to set the EnanoBot root directory (where your config and enanobot.php
are). DO NOT put enanobot.php and config.php in your document root - you WILL get
hacked.

To start it, run:

  $ php enanobot.php

You may find it useful to make sure that it restarts if it dies. Once you've started
the bot and confirmed that it works, do something like: (and this is really hackish)

  $ while true; do php enanobot.php; done &

This all assumes that you're on a Unix-based server. Things will be different on
Windows.
